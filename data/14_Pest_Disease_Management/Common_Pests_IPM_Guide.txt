WHAT IS IPM?
-----------
Integrated Pest Management is an eco-friendly approach that combines:
- Cultural practices
- Biological control
- Mechanical methods
- Chemical control (as last resort)

GOAL: Keep pests below Economic Threshold Level (ETL) using eco-friendly methods

PRINCIPLES OF IPM:
-----------------
1. Pest monitoring and identification
2. Prevention is better than cure
3. Economic Threshold Level (ETL) concept
4. Multiple control methods (integrated approach)
5. Conserve natural enemies
6. Judicious use of pesticides

================================================================================
SECTION 3: IPM IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
================================================================================

STEP 1: MONITORING & SURVEILLANCE
---------------------------------
- Field scouting: 2-3 times per week
- Check 20 plants randomly across field
- Record pest/disease incidence
- Use monitoring tools:
  * Pheromone traps (pest monitoring)
  * Light traps (adult moth catch)
  * Yellow/Blue sticky traps (sucking pests)

DECISION MAKING:
- Compare with ETL
- If below ETL → Continue monitoring
- If at/above ETL → Initiate control measures

STEP 2: PREVENTIVE MEASURES
---------------------------
BEFORE SOWING:
- Summer ploughing (exposes pests to sun/predators)
- Crop rotation
- Clean field (remove previous crop residues)

AT SOWING:
- Seed treatment (insecticide + fungicide + bio-agent)
- Use resistant/tolerant varieties
- Optimum spacing (air circulation)

DURING CROP GROWTH:
- Balanced fertilization (avoid excess N)
- Timely irrigation (avoid stress)
- Weed management (removes alternate hosts)

STEP 3: NON-CHEMICAL CONTROL
----------------------------
PHYSICAL/MECHANICAL:
- Hand picking of larvae/egg masses
- Pruning and destroying infected plant parts
- Trap crops (marigold for bollworm)
- Bird perches @ 25/ha
- Sticky traps

BIOLOGICAL:
- Trichogramma (egg parasitoid) - 6 releases @ 50,000/ha
- NPV (virus for caterpillars) @ 250 LE/ha
- Trichoderma (for soil-borne diseases) @ 2.5 kg/ha
- Pseudomonas fluorescens (bacterial antagonist)

BOTANICAL:
- Neem-based products (Azadirachtin 0.03% @ 2.5 L/ha)
- NSKE (Neem Seed Kernel Extract @ 5%)
- Pongamia oil @ 2%

STEP 4: CHEMICAL CONTROL (Last Resort)
-------------------------------------
PRINCIPLES:
1. Use only when ETL is crossed
2. Choose least toxic, target-specific insecticide
3. Rotate insecticides (different modes of action)
4. Follow recommended dose
5. Apply at right time (pest stage, time of day)

APPLICATION TIMING:
- Early morning (6-10 AM) or evening (4-6 PM)
- Avoid midday (high temperature reduces efficacy)
- No spraying before rain (wash off)

SPRAYING TECHNIQUE:
- Water volume: 500 liters/ha
- Thorough coverage (especially lower leaf surface)
- Use proper nozzle
- Maintain spray pressure

SAFETY:
- Wear protective equipment (mask, gloves)
- Don't eat/smoke during spraying
- Bathe after spraying
- Observe pre-harvest interval (PHI)

================================================================================
SECTION 4: INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE MANAGEMENT (IRM)
================================================================================

WHY IRM IS IMPORTANT:
- Repeated use of same insecticide → resistance
- Leads to control failure
- Requires higher doses (unsafe)

IRM STRATEGIES:

1. ROTATE INSECTICIDES (Different Groups):
   - Group 1 (Organophosphates): Chlorpyriphos, Profenophos
   - Group 2 (Carbamates): Carbofuran, Cartap
   - Group 3 (Pyrethroids): Cypermethrin, Lambda-cyhalothrin
   - Group 4 (Neonicotinoids): Imidacloprid, Thiamethoxam
   - Group 5 (Spinosyns): Spinosad
   - Group 28 (Diamides): Chlorantraniliprole, Flubendiamide
   
   **Use different groups in rotation**

2. AVOID CONSECUTIVE APPLICATIONS:
   - Don't spray same insecticide 2-3 times consecutively
   - Switch to different mode of action

3. TANK MIXES:
   - Mix insecticides from different groups
   - Example: Contact + Systemic

4. REFUGE STRATEGY (for Bt Cotton):
   - Plant 20% non-Bt cotton as refuge
   - Delays resistance development

================================================================================
SECTION 5: NATURAL ENEMY CONSERVATION
================================================================================

KEY PREDATORS:
- Spiders: Rice, cotton (general predators)
- Ladybird Beetles: Aphids, whitefly nymphs
- Chrysoperla: Eggs and young larvae of pests
- Mirid Bugs: BPH, WBPH nymphs
- Ground Beetles: Cutworms, soil-dwelling larvae

KEY PARASITOIDS:
- Trichogramma spp.: Egg parasitoid of bollworms, borers
- Bracon spp.: Larval parasitoid of stem borer
- Apanteles spp.: Larval parasitoid of leaf folder

HOW TO CONSERVE:
1. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides
2. Plant border crops (marigold, maize) - provide habitat
3. Maintain flowering plants (nectar source)
4. Allow some weeds (harbor beneficial insects)
5. Use selective insecticides if needed

================================================================================
SECTION 6: ECONOMIC THRESHOLD LEVEL (ETL) CONCEPT
================================================================================

WHAT IS ETL?
The pest density at which control measures should be initiated to prevent economic damage.

WHY ETL?
- Prevents unnecessary spraying
- Reduces cost
- Protects natural enemies
- Prevents resistance development

EXAMPLE ETLs:
Crop         Pest                ETL
-----        ----                ---
Paddy        Stem Borer          5% dead hearts
Paddy        BPH                 10-15 hoppers/plant
Cotton       Bollworm            1-2 larvae/plant or 8-10% damage
Cotton       Whitefly            5-10 adults/leaf
Groundnut    Leaf miner          2 mines/leaf
Maize        Fall Armyworm       5% plants with whorl damage

**Don't spray below ETL - waste of money and harmful to environment**

================================================================================
SECTION 7: PESTICIDE SAFETY & PRECAUTIONS
================================================================================

BEFORE USE:
- Read label carefully
- Check expiry date
- Use recommended dose

DURING USE:
- Wear protective clothing (mask, gloves, full sleeves)
- Mix in open space (good ventilation)
- Don't eat/drink/smoke
- Spray in calm weather (no wind)

AFTER USE:
- Bathe with soap
- Wash clothes separately
- Store pesticides in locked cupboard
- Keep away from children, food, fodder

DISPOSAL:
- Don't throw containers in water bodies
- Triple rinse empty containers
- Bury or hand over to authorized recyclers

IN CASE OF POISONING:
- Remove contaminated clothing
- Wash with plenty of water
- Seek medical help immediately
- Carry pesticide label/container to doctor

**Helpline:** Poison Control: 1066 or nearest hospital
