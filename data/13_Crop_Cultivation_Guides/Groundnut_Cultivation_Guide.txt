SOIL REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------
Best: Sandy loam, red sandy soils
pH: 6.0-7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral)
Depth: 45-60 cm (deep-rooted crop)
Drainage: Essential (waterlogging is fatal)
Avoid: Heavy clay soils, saline soils

LAND PREPARATION:
----------------
1. Summer ploughing in May (for Kharif crop)
2. 2-3 harrowing after first rain
3. Leveling for uniform germination
4. Ridges and furrows (60 cm apart) for rainfed areas
5. Flat beds for irrigated areas

SEED REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------
Bunch types: 75-80 kg/ha (25-30 kg/acre)
Spreading types: 100-120 kg/ha (40-50 kg/acre)
Use bold, healthy seeds from previous season

SEED TREATMENT (Mandatory):
--------------------------
1. Shell manually (avoid damage to seeds)
2. Fungicide: Thiram @ 3 gm/kg seed
3. Insecticide: Imidacloprid @ 5 gm/kg seed
4. Rhizobium culture @ 25 gm/kg seed (for N fixation)
5. PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) @ 25 gm/kg

SOWING METHOD:
-------------
Method: Dibbling or seed drill
Depth: 5-7 cm (not too deep, not shallow)
Spacing:
  - Bunch types: 30 cm x 10 cm or 22.5 cm x 10 cm
  - Spreading types: 45 cm x 15 cm

Seeds per hill: 1-2 (single seed is ideal)

IRRIGATION:
----------
Critical Stages (MUST irrigate if no rain):
1. Flowering stage (30-40 DAS)
2. Pegging stage (50-60 DAS) - MOST CRITICAL
3. Pod development (70-80 DAS)

Total water requirement: 500-600 mm

Schedule:
- Pre-sowing irrigation (if soil is dry)
- First irrigation: 20-25 DAS
- Subsequently: 10-15 day interval depending on soil moisture

Drip Irrigation:
- Highly recommended for summer groundnut
- 40-50% water saving
- Subsidy: 55% for small/marginal farmers under PMKSY
- Apply 4 liters/plant/day

FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT:
---------------------
NPK: 20-25:60:50 kg/ha
(Low N because it's a legume - fixes its own nitrogen)

CRITICAL: Gypsum 400-500 kg/ha at flowering (35-40 DAS)
Why? Provides Calcium and Sulphur - essential for pod filling

APPLICATION SCHEDULE:
Basal (At sowing):
  - Full NPK (Urea 43 kg + SSP 375 kg + MOP 83 kg/ha)
  - FYM: 5-7 tonnes/ha (2 weeks before sowing)
  - If using DAP, don't use SSP (provides both N and P)

AT FLOWERING (35-40 DAS):
  - GYPSUM: 400-500 kg/ha (MANDATORY - broadcast and mix)
  - This is THE MOST IMPORTANT fertilizer application
  - Directly affects pod filling and oil content

Foliar Spray:
  - 2% DAP at flowering and pod development
  - Boron 0.2% (prevents hollow heart)
  - Helps in pod filling

WEED MANAGEMENT:
---------------
Critical Period: First 30-40 days

Cultural:
- Hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS
- Inter-cultivation with blade harrow
- Mulching with crop residues

Chemical:
Pre-emergence (within 2-3 days of sowing):
  - Pendimethalin 30 EC @ 3.3 liters/ha
  - Imazethapyr 10 SL @ 1 liter/ha

Post-emergence (20 DAS):
  - Quizalofop ethyl 5 EC @ 1 liter/ha (for grasses)
  - Hand weeding is safer

PEST MANAGEMENT:
---------------
Major Pests:

1. LEAF MINER (Aproaerema modicella):
   Damage: Serpentine mines on leaves
   Control: Profenophos 50 EC @ 2 ml/liter
   
2. TOBACCO CATERPILLAR (Spodoptera litura):
   Damage: Defoliation
   Control: NPV @ 250 LE/ha or Emamectin benzoate @ 300 gm/ha
   
3. APHIDS (Aphis craccivora):
   Damage: Leaf curling, rosette disease vector
   Control: Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 200 ml/ha
   ETL: 10-15 aphids/plant

4. THRIPS (Scirtothrips dorsalis):
   Damage: Leaf browning, silvering
   Control: Fipronil 5 SC @ 2 ml/liter

5. TERMITES (Odontotermes spp.):
   Damage: Seed/pod damage
   Control: Seed treatment with Imidacloprid or
           Chlorpyriphos 20 EC @ 5 liters/ha (soil drench)

6. WHITE GRUBS (Holotrichia consanguinea):
   Damage: Root damage
   Control: Chlorpyriphos 20 EC @ 5 liters/ha

DISEASE MANAGEMENT:
------------------
Major Diseases:

1. TIKKA DISEASE (Early & Late Leaf Spot):
   Caused by: Cercospora arachidicola & Phaeoisariopsis personata
   Symptoms: Circular brown spots with yellow halo
   Control: 
     - Resistant varieties (Kadiri 9)
     - Mancozeb 75 WP @ 2.5 kg/ha (3 sprays at 15-day interval)
     - Carbendazim 50 WP @ 500 gm/ha
     - Start spraying from 30 DAS

2. RUST (Puccinia arachidis):
   Symptoms: Orange pustules on lower leaf surface
   Control:
     - Resistant varieties (TMV 13)
     - Sulfur dust @ 25 kg/ha
     - Tebuconazole 25.9 EC @ 1 ml/liter

3. STEM ROT (Sclerotium rolfsii):
   Symptoms: Wilting, collar region rotting
   Control:
     - Crop rotation
     - Trichoderma viride @ 10 gm/kg seed treatment
     - Carbendazim 50 WP @ 1 gm/liter (soil drench)

4. COLLAR ROT (Aspergillus niger):
   Symptoms: Black discoloration at collar region
   Control:
     - Seed treatment with Thiram
     - Avoid waterlogging

5. BUD NECROSIS DISEASE (Virus):
   Symptoms: Necrotic spots on leaves, stunting
   Vector: Thrips
   Control:
     - Control thrips with Imidacloprid
     - Remove and destroy infected plants

6. AFLATOXIN CONTAMINATION:
   Prevention:
     - Harvest at right maturity (don't delay)
     - Dry immediately after harvest
     - Store at 10% moisture or less
     - Avoid contact with soil during drying

HARVESTING:
----------
Maturity Indices:
- 80% of pods show brown/black veins inside shell
- Leaves turn yellowish and start shedding
- Kernel skin turns pink (for TMV varieties)
- 100-120 days for Kharif, 95-110 days for Rabi/Summer

Method:
1. Stop irrigation 10-15 days before harvest
2. Pull out plants manually (early morning preferred)
3. Shake off excess soil
4. Stack in windrows with pods facing one direction
5. Leave in field for 2-3 days for curing

DO NOT delay harvesting - leads to:
  - Germination in soil (if rains occur)
  - Pod rot
  - Aflatoxin contamination
  - Shattering and loss

THRESHING & DRYING:
------------------
Threshing:
- Manual beating with sticks OR
- Mechanical thresher (95% efficiency)
- Separate pods from haulms

Drying:
- Spread pods in thin layer on pucca floor
- Sun drying for 4-5 days
- Target moisture: 8-10% for storage
- Turn pods 2-3 times daily

Storage:
- Store in gunny bags in dry, well-ventilated place
- Check moisture periodically
- Use neem leaves to prevent storage pests

Problem 3: Aphid Infestation
Cause: Dry weather, vector of rosette disease
Solution: Imidacloprid spray immediately when noticed

Problem 4: Germination Failure
Cause: Deep sowing, seed quality, soil crusting
Solution: Sow at 5-7 cm depth, use quality seeds, light irrigation

Problem 5: Yellowing of Leaves
Cause: Iron deficiency (in alkaline soils) or nitrogen deficiency
Solution: FeSO4 0.5% spray or 2% Urea spray

BEST PRACTICES FOR HIGH YIELD:
-----------------------------
1. Use certified seeds of recommended varieties
2. Mandatory seed treatment (fungicide + insecticide + Rhizobium)
3. Timely sowing (first fortnight of June for Kharif)
4. Maintain proper spacing (don't crowd plants)
5. GYPSUM APPLICATION IS MUST - never skip
6. Irrigate at critical stages (flowering, pegging, pod development)
7. Control tikka disease with 3 fungicide sprays
8. Harvest at right maturity (don't delay)
9. Dry to 8-10% moisture before storage
10. Crop rotation (avoid continuous groundnut)
