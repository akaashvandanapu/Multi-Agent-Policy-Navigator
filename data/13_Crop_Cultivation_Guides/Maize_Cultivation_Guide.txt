- Maize + Soybean (1:1) - In assured rainfall areas

CROP ROTATION:
-------------
Recommended:
Year 1: Maize → Year 2: Legumes (Greengram/Blackgram)
OR
Kharif Maize → Rabi Vegetables → Summer Greengram

USES OF MAIZE:
-------------
1. Human Food: Roasted corn, cornflakes, popcorn, sweet corn
2. Animal Feed: Poultry feed (70% of maize goes to poultry)
3. Industrial: Starch, oil, biofuel, glucose
4. Fodder: Green fodder for cattle (nutritious)

MARKETING:
---------
Options:
1. Poultry feed mills (major buyer - 70%)
2. Starch industries
3. Regulated markets
4. Direct to food processing units (sweet corn, baby corn)

Best Season for Selling: Rabi crop (less supply, better price)

GOVERNMENT SUPPORT:
------------------
- No MSP for maize currently
- Crop Insurance: PMFBY available
- Seeds: Subsidized through department
- Credit: KCC facility available

COMMON PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS:
---------------------------
Problem 1: Poor Germination
Cause: Old seeds, deep sowing, soil crusting
Solution: Use certified seeds, sow at 4-5 cm, light irrigation

Problem 2: Barren Plants (No Cobs)
Cause: Water stress during tasseling
Solution: Must irrigate at 45-60 DAS period

Problem 3: Fall Armyworm Attack
Cause: Recent pest, widespread
Solution: Spray Emamectin benzoate + Chlorantraniliprole in rotation

Problem 4: Cob Not Filled
Cause: Poor pollination, water stress
Solution: Ensure adequate plants/ha, irrigate at silking

Problem 5: Lodging (Plants Falling)
Cause: Stalk rot, excess N, heavy rain/wind
Solution: Balanced fertilization, timely harvest

BEST PRACTICES:
--------------
1. Use certified hybrid seeds (don't save seeds)
2. Maintain proper plant population (60,000-75,000/ha)
3. MUST irrigate at tasseling and silking stages
4. Split nitrogen application (3 doses)
5. Control fall armyworm early (scout fields)
6. Harvest at right moisture (20-25%)
7. Dry to 12-14% before storage
8. Crop rotation to break pest cycle

SPECIAL CROP: BABY CORN
-----------------------
(Very profitable but requires labor)
- High density planting (1 lakh plants/ha)
- Harvest young cobs (2-3 days after silking)
- 4-6 pickings over 15-20 days
- Remove husk and silk immediately
- Pack and sell fresh (perishable)
- High demand in cities, hotels
- Very profitable: Rs. 3-5 lakh/ha profit

REMEMBER:
✓ Maize is sensitive to water stress at tasseling
✓ Never skip irrigation at 45-60 DAS period
✓ Fall armyworm is a serious pest - monitor regularly
✓ Hybrid seeds give 30-40% more yield than composites
✓ Baby corn and sweet corn are highly profitable
✓ Don't save hybrid seeds for next season (F1 hybrid)

"Water at Tasseling = Good Cob Formation = High Yield!"
