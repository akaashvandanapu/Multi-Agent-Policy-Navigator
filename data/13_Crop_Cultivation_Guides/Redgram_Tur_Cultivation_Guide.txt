- Single harvest or 3-4 pickings

DURATION TYPES:
--------------
SHORT DURATION (120-140 days):
- ICPL 88039 (Asha): 120-130 days, 15-18 q/ha
- Suitable for: Late sowing, sequential cropping

MEDIUM DURATION (150-170 days):

SOIL REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------
Best: Black cotton soils (Vertisols), red soils
pH: 6.5-7.5 (slightly acidic to neutral)
Depth: Deep soils (>75 cm) - has deep taproot
Drainage: Good drainage essential (sensitive to waterlogging)
Avoid: Highly acidic, saline, waterlogged soils

LAND PREPARATION:
----------------
1. One deep ploughing in summer (May)
2. 1-2 harrowing after first rain
3. Broad Bed and Furrow (BBF) system recommended
   - Beds: 150 cm wide, 15 cm high
   - Furrows: 30 cm wide (for drainage)
4. Opening of furrows for drainage

Note: Minimum tillage is okay (redgram is hardy)

SEED REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------
Sole Crop:
- Long duration: 15-18 kg/ha (6-7 kg/acre)
- Medium duration: 18-20 kg/ha (7-8 kg/acre)
- Short duration: 20-22 kg/ha (8-9 kg/acre)

Intercrop (with cotton/sorghum): 8-10 kg/ha

Use bold, healthy, disease-free seeds

SEED TREATMENT (Mandatory):
--------------------------
1. Fungicide: Thiram or Carbendazim @ 2 gm/kg seed
2. Rhizobium culture @ 25 gm/kg seed (N fixation)
3. PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) @ 25 gm/kg
4. Trichoderma viride @ 10 gm/kg (wilt prevention)

Seed treatment is CRITICAL for:
  - Disease prevention (wilt, sterility mosaic)
  - Nitrogen fixation (Rhizobium)
  - Nutrient availability (PSB)

SOWING:
------
Method: Dibbling or seed drill
Depth: 4-5 cm
Spacing:

SOLE CROP:
- Long duration: 150 cm x 75 cm or 120 cm x 90 cm
- Medium duration: 90 cm x 60 cm or 120 cm x 75 cm
- Short duration: 75 cm x 30 cm or 60 cm x 30 cm

INTERCROPPING WITH COTTON:
- Cotton + Redgram: 2:1 or 3:1 ratio
- Example: 2 rows cotton (90 cm apart) : 1 row redgram

INTERCROPPING WITH SORGHUM:
- Sorghum + Redgram: 2:2 or 3:3 ratio

Seeds per hill: 2-3 (thin to 1-2 plants later)
Thinning: 20-25 days after sowing

IRRIGATION:
----------
Redgram is mostly rainfed but responds well to irrigation.

Critical Stages (if irrigation available):
1. Flowering stage (75-90 DAS)
2. Pod development (100-120 DAS)

Rainfed: Can tolerate drought due to deep taproot
Irrigated: 2-3 protective irrigations increase yield by 30-40%

Avoid waterlogging at all costs (fatal for redgram)

FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT:
---------------------
NPK: 20-25:50:25 kg/ha
(Note: Low N as it's a legume - fixes own nitrogen)

FERTILIZER EQUIVALENT:
- Urea: 43-54 kg/ha (or SKIP if good Rhizobium inoculation)
- SSP: 313 kg/ha (provides P + S + Ca)
- MOP: 42 kg/ha

APPLICATION:
ALL AT SOWING (Basal):
- Full N + P + K
- FYM: 5-7 tonnes/ha (if available)
- Gypsum: 125 kg/ha (provides S + Ca)

NO TOP DRESSING needed (one-time application)

SPECIAL NOTES:
- Phosphorus is most critical for nodulation
- Sulphur (20 kg/ha) improves yield - apply as Gypsum
- Boron deficiency common - apply 5 kg Borax/ha
- Avoid excess nitrogen (causes vegetative growth, delays flowering)

WEED MANAGEMENT:
---------------
Critical Period: First 45-60 days

Cultural:
- Hand weeding at 25 and 45 DAS
- Inter-cultivation at 30 DAS (also helps in aeration)
- Mulching reduces weed pressure

Chemical:
Pre-emergence (within 2-3 days):
  - Pendimethalin 30 EC @ 3.3 liters/ha
  - Apply as spray in 500 liters water

Post-emergence (20 DAS):
  - Imazethapyr 10 SL @ 1 liter/ha (pulse-specific herbicide)
  - Apply as directed spray

In Intercropping:
- Be careful with herbicides (may damage companion crop)
- Hand weeding safer option

PEST MANAGEMENT:
---------------
Major Pests:

1. POD BORER COMPLEX (Most serious pest):

A. Helicoverpa armigera (Pod borer):
   Damage: Bore into pods, feed on developing seeds
   ETL: 2 larvae/plant or 10% pod damage
   Control:
     - NPV (HaNPV) @ 250 LE/ha (start at flower initiation)
     - Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 200 gm/ha
     - Indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 333 ml/ha
     - Spinosad 45 SC @ 125 ml/ha
   Timing: Start spraying at 50% flowering, repeat at 10-day interval

B. Maruca vitrata (Spotted pod borer):
   Damage: Webbing on flowers and pods, pod damage
   Control: Same as Helicoverpa

2. POD FLY (Melanagromyza obtusa):
   Damage: Maggots feed on developing seeds
   Control:
     - Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.5 liters/ha
     - Monocrotophos 36 SL @ 1.25 liters/ha

3. PLUME MOTH (Exelastis atomosa):
   Damage: Caterpillar feeds on flowers and young pods
   Control: Same as pod borer

4. BLISTER BEETLE (Mylabris spp.):
   Damage: Adult feeds on flowers and young pods
   Control: Hand picking and destruction OR
            Malathion 50 EC @ 2 ml/liter

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM):
- Pheromone traps: 8-10/ha for monitoring
- Light traps: 1/ha
- Bird perches: 20-25/ha (insectivorous birds)
- Intercropping: Reduces pest incidence
- Neem oil @ 2%: Spray at flower initiation
- NPV: Biological control, eco-friendly

DISEASE MANAGEMENT:
------------------
Major Diseases:

1. WILT (Fusarium udum) - Most serious disease:
   Symptoms: Sudden yellowing, drooping, wilting, plant death
   Favorable: High soil temperature, moisture stress

     - Use resistant varieties (WRG 158, LRG 41)
     - Seed treatment with Carbendazim @ 2 gm/kg
     - Soil treatment with Trichoderma @ 2.5 kg/ha
     - Crop rotation (avoid continuous redgram)
     - Deep summer ploughing
     - No cure once disease sets in

2. STERILITY MOSAIC DISEASE (SMD) - Viral disease:
   Symptoms: Excessive vegetative growth, small pale green leaves, 
             no flowering, bushy appearance
   Vector: Eriophyid mite
   Control:
     - Use tolerant varieties (LRG 41, ICPL 87119)
     - Rogue out infected plants early
     - Control mites with Dicofol 18.5 EC @ 2.5 ml/liter
     - Avoid late sowing

3. PHYTOPHTHORA BLIGHT:
   Symptoms: Water-soaked lesions on stem, leaf drop, sudden wilting
   Favorable: High humidity, waterlogging

   Symptoms: White powdery coating on leaves
   Control:
     - Sulfur dust @ 25 kg/ha
     - Carbendazim 50 WP @ 500 gm/ha

FLOWERING & POD SETTING:
-----------------------
Flowering: 
- Medium duration: 60-75 days after sowing
- Long duration: 90-110 days after sowing

Pod setting: Depends on:
- Water availability (stress reduces pod set)
- Temperature (high temperature affects pollination)
- Pest damage (pod borers)

Tips for better pod set:
- Irrigate during flowering if possible
- Control pod borers strictly
- Apply 2% DAP spray at flowering (improves pod set)
- Boron spray @ 0.2% (better flower retention)

HARVESTING:
----------
Maturity Indices:
- Leaves turn yellowish and start shedding
- Pods turn brown/straw colored
- Seeds become hard
- 150-200 days after sowing (variety-dependent)

Harvesting Methods:

SINGLE HARVEST (Short & Medium duration):
- When 70-80% pods mature
- Cut plants at ground level
- Stack in small heaps for 5-7 days (curing)
- Thresh manually or mechanically

MULTIPLE PICKINGS (Long duration):
- 3-4 pickings at 15-20 day intervals
- Pick mature pods (brown color)
- Continue pickings till all pods mature
- Higher yield but more labor

THRESHING & PROCESSING:
----------------------
Threshing:
- Manual beating with sticks
- Mechanical thresher (90% efficiency)
- Clean grains using winnowing

Drying:
- Sun drying to 10-12% moisture
- Spread on pucca floor
- 2-3 days drying

Grading:
- Remove broken, damaged, immature grains
- Bold grains fetch better price

Storage:
